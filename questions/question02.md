## Question 2: Split the line

Write a program in your favorite interpreted language to split a line of text into 2 lines as close to the same length as possible without splitting a word. If it is impossible to make the lines equal, the second line should be the longer one.

**Example**

Given:

> This is the first line and this is the second line, which is longer.

Expected result:

```txt
This is the first line and this
is the second line, which is longer.
```

Incorrect:

```txt
This is the first line and this is
the second line, which is longer.
```

```txt
This is the first line and this i
s the second line, which is longer.
```

```txt
This is the first line and this is the second line,
which is longer
```

```txt
This is the first line
and this is the second line, which is longer
```
