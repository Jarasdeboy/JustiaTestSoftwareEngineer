## Question 4: 99 Beers

This is a "Code Golf" challenge. Code golf is a type of recreational computer programming competition in which participants strive to achieve the shortest possible source code that implements a certain algorithm:

- The shorter the better
- No restrictions on the programming language that you can use
- Don't worry about optimizations, readability, and maintainability.
- The language knowledge & mastery is preferred over the algorithmic skills
- Don't copy & print directly from the source file

The challenge is to write a script that reproduces the lyrics of the song “99 Bottles of Beer” and send them to standard output. You can find the lyrics [here](question04-file.txt).

Your script needs to:

- **Output the exact same content as the text file above.**
- Be as short in character length as possible.
